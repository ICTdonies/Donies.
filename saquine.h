                        ABOUT FAMILY<br> 

                        My parents sell barbeque and I'm the second of the siblings. I'm very happy because they've become my family even though there's a problem, they're still happy. and of course the happiest thing in life is bonding because they only have a break once in a while because of selling. and above all we will go to church together.</p>
